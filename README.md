# Deep Learning Introduction
  Deep Learning is defines about to working on complex neural network. This topic is subset of the Machine Learning .
Types of layers of Deep Learning:
# Input Layer
  Receives the raw data to the machine.
# Hidden Layer
  Perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data
# Outer Layer
Provide the final output and prediction on Classification

#  Activation functions in deep learning:

#  1.ReLU:Rectified Liner Unit:
  This is used in hidden layer to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
#  2.Sigmoid:
  Map the values Binary(0 and 1 in the layer).
#  3.Softmax
  Convert the raw data (score) convert into the probability on the given data.
# Back propogation and Optimisation
  In this propagration step we use some of the example - MSE(means standard error),cross entropy stop: Which are optimises the data.
